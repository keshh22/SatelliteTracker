# Satellite Tracker

This is a tracker that we designed to solve one of our our challenges to “set your sights high”. It’s a simulation of the earth, the surrounding satellites, space debris and combines all of their information and data when asked to, like an immersing 3 dimensional experience. It pulls all the flight path data from scraped existing web sources and displays them in an elliptical format. It’s made with HTML, CSS, JS and open sources (Three.min.js and Tween.js). This app can be used as an interactive way to understand what satellites or objects are currently circling the earth, and it satisfies the curiosity and passion to learn.
